      <h1>My name is Solomon Hensey</h1>
      <p>I am a student who is learning about web development. In my free time I enjoy reading, writing my own stories, along with playing both video games as well as Dungeons & Dragons with my friends. I enjoy trying to solve problems and puzzles that make me think more strategically and deal with multiple different moving parts.</p>
