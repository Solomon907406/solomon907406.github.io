# About me
## My Interests
	-Writing
		-I tend to do some writing in my free time, which will have a document linked to show the only story that I have completed so far. The story is titled [As Light Falls](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CoLNssflEA84enAlC9lQqHWLctIpsv_TA8wBA6Ckya8/edit?tab=t.0)
	-Dungeons and Dragons
		-I play quite a bit of Dungeons and Dragons, and I also run some games as well.

## Websites I recommend
	-[Roll20](www.app.roll20.net) - I use Roll20 to run and play my online Dungeons and Dragons sessions since most of the people who I play with are people who I am unable to play with in person for a variety of reasons.
	-[YouTube](www.youtube.com) - YouTube has become one of the main ways that I get news aside from sources like Wral, CNN, the BBC, and other similar news organisations. I also use YouTube for purposes that are just to find out what is out on the web.
